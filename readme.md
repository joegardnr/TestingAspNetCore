# Automated Testing of ASP.Net Core
Automated Testing helps ensure your application actually does what you think it should. These code samples and slides are from a talk that explores approaches for testing of ASP.Net Core Web Applications. It starts with an example that requires only the tools you already have (hint: its powershell). From there, it looks at how adding modern testing frameworks (like xUnit) and tooling (like dotnet test) can really accelerate your dev-test cycle.

## Getting Started
I recommend working the samples in this order:
1) Demo.WebAPI.Tests.Powershell
1) Demo.WebAPI.Tests.xUnit
1) Demo.WebAPI.Tests.TestHost
1) Demo.WebAPI.Tests.Alba
1) Demo.WebMVC.Tests

If you create any new samples that you think are worth adding, please let me know!
